# RR2-PSP-Sky-Texture-Changer
To start switching skies from different courses, first open textures.ini... 
As you can see, on each line a course is assigned with a texture named "skyN.png".
Currently every course has its original texture (number of track corresponding to N)
You can try to change N and see the effects ingame!

IMPORTANT(!): 
1) I couldn't find Britenight's texture so I inserted a reflection one to get it work on other maps,
and because of that changing textures on this specific track is not possible :/
2) Don't try to change Edgestone's texture as it will burn your eye...
3) Same thing applies to Shuttleloop where the first person mirror view will look white
